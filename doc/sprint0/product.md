## FitBook

---

### **What are you planning to build?**

Fitbook is a novel fitness social media app, designed to integrate the benefits of a fitness tracker with the connectivity of a social media platform. The fundamental purpose of this project is to encourage regular physical activity by creating an engaging and socially interactive environment. In the modern digital age, many struggle to maintain a consistent fitness regimen, often due to a lack of motivation or accountability. Fitbook addresses this problem by leveraging the power of social networking. Users can share their workouts, repost fitness content from their friends, and track their own workout progress. The app's unique features not only help users stay physically active but also promote a sense of community, fostering encouragement and healthy competition.

### **Who are your target users?**

The primary target audience for Fitbook is fitness enthusiasts and individuals striving to maintain or improve their health, particularly within the age range of 16-50 years. This wide demographic is characterized by their active lifestyle or the desire to adopt one, and their frequent use of social media platforms for communication and sharing personal milestones. Fitbook meets the needs of this audience by providing a dedicated platform where they can share their fitness progress, access workout ideas, and engage in a supportive, fitness-focused community. The integrated workout tracking feature also addresses a common need among this demographic for a simple, user-friendly method to monitor their fitness progress over time.

### **Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?**

The primary target audience will use Fitbook mainly to engage and interact with the fitness community, which actively motivates users to remain physically active. It proposes a comprehensive solution to the identified problem by developing an app that combines the features of a fitness tracker with the interactivity of a social media platform. Users will be able to log their workouts, track their progress, share their fitness milestones, discover new routines, and connect with like-minded individuals for inspiration and motivation. The social sharing and engagement elements of Fitbook are believed to increase user accountability and motivation, fostering a more consistent fitness regimen among users. Further, the app's integration with various workout formats makes it a versatile tool for any fitness enthusiast, regardless of their preferred workout style. Screenshots and examples of similar interfaces are provided in the Appendices to further illustrate these features.


### **What does "DONE" means to your Team?**

A feature implementation is “complete” when the implementation functionally satisfies the specifications given by the specific user story or requirement. This also means that your function is thoroughly tested whether manually or by unit tests. Furthermore, the app is considered finished when all user stories and requirements have been “completed”. Additionally, one of the reviewers for your user story should be able to replicate those tests. 

### **Highlights**

#### *Choice of product (fitness app)*

The thought process behind our decision to create a fitness app was based primarily on two reasons. The core functionality of the application largely aligns with our groups’ personal interests. Furthermore, since the pandemic, there has been an increasing number of consumers investing in their personal health. Some alternatives were considered, including an AI note taking app to help an individual take notes and give useful suggestions, and another project consisted of a calorie-tracking app with AI integration to facilitate the process of tracking your health status and provide useful suggestions for day-to-day life. However, the implementation of machine learning algorithms, and the time required to train these algorithms was determined to be too big of a challenge to complete over the duration of the course.

#### *Choice of API (REST)*

We heavily considered using GraphQL instead of REST API because there are multiple benefits in using GraphQL for a project with a social media component for the application. Since GraphQL can get specific data from a single request whereas REST depends solely on endpoints, it can be advantageous and faster to use GraphQL instead of REST. However, because of the lack of experience our group members have with GraphQL and the course already teaches REST, we decided to go with REST since it would be the least time consuming and more intuitive decision to make since we predict that the course load for this course will be very heavy during the coming weeks.

#### *Choice of front end (React Native)*

Since the nature of FitBook involves being used in a setting where browser access can be limited (such as at a fitness centre), we decided that deploying an application as opposed to a website would be best. We chose React Native because it allows us to build our application on one codebase, which can then be deployed to both iOS and Android platforms. Furthermore, as React Native is a popular framework used across numerous mobile application development industries, we decided that undertaking a project using React can offer valuable experience that would be beneficial for future job opportunities. 

#### *Choice of database (MongoDB)*

When choosing a database for our application, we wanted a NoSQL option as our application requires fast scalability and flexibility when working with data. As well, it allows us to create new models for objects without needing to modify the schema as a whole. These advantages increase output speed when working in a limited amount of sprints. Using MongoDB specifically allows us to work with a document database using a JSON-like format which fits with our JS focused frontend and backend.

#### *How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?*

For team organization, we usually talk about new ideas/problems/solutions or general discussions about what each person is going to work on during our meetings that have set times. As the project advances, more specific roles are likely going to be assigned to specific group member(s). As for the tools, we used the ones that were necessary such as JIRA for agile development planning and Slack for stand-ups and communication. There were other tools such as mural.co for brainstorming and drawing simple workflows of project ideas that we came up with. 

#### *How frequently did you meet?*

Synchronous meetings were held every two days on weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), while asynchronous meetings were held on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
